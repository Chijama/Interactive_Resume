# interactiveresume

This Application is my Resume with interactive elements. Interactive resumes  
 shake up the traditional resume format by displaying your education, skills, history, experiences
 and so on in a more fun way, and online. 

The application is made of one screen and divided into 8 sections 
-Intro picture
- About Me
- Education
- My Expiriences
- Skills
- Projects
- Certifications
- Contact

The Codebase consists of 
- one screen 
- six widgets
- two models

the inspiration for the design was sourced from  https://champ96k.github.io/#/

The libraries used in this projects are:
- font_awesome_flutter to access specific Icons to suit my needs
- google_fonts for easy access to a wide variety of fonts
- liquid_progress_indicator for graphical representation of the status of a variable
- scaled_list to provide a visually appealing UI representation of a horizontal list
- url_launcher to launch urls

Future Features to consider :
- Automatic Dark mode enabling
- Language enabling
- Splash screen

Major Challenge I faced:
- Working with scaled_list library was confusing and not very flexible
